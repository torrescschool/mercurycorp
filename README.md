For our software engineering project, we propose developing a comprehensive database to digitize and securely store records that are currently maintained on paper, including electronic health records (EHR) and employee files. These records will be systematically organized to facilitate easy access and management. Our project will then expand into creating a software platform—a website or application—equipped with powerful search capabilities, categorization tools, and reporting features, serving as the system’s backend. Once this foundation is established, we will build modules to support Human Resources in employee needs and a dedicated interface for nurses. This nursing interface will not only enable quick retrieval of resident records but will also include a chatbot designed to assist with policy and procedure guidance, bias checking, and facility information. Additionally, the software will cater to the diverse needs of medical professionals by offering customizable options, such as language adjustments and accessibility features like a dyslexia-friendly setup. This tool will be especially valuable for agency personnel, enhancing their workflow and improving patient care.

Softwares similar are available (Point Click Care) however they do not support a variety of features and many instances, many applications will be needed to complete these tasks, These can often times not be user friendly and very expensive for facilities like non-profits. Our project will not only combine these in a simple interface, but also be open-source. 



## Requirements:
1. Make a Database filled with the patients, their information, and medical records. Also adding fake data to test if pulling database information will work.
2.  Having a simple website, that is clear and concise, bringing up user-information. Depending on who is logging in, there will be 3 different views, an employee view, a nurse view, and a patient view. These views will show different information that is relevant to that person (for example, an employer can see the nurse information, but not the information on the patients they treat. The nurse will have access to their patients information, but not HR's).
3.  Make a log in feature that showcases if person X logs in, they're able to see certain things.
4.  figuring out to integrate a PDF viewer onto the website to access medical records.
